I created this project to demonstrate my ability to not only design specification but also implement clinical data listings. It highlights my skills to translate specifications into dynamic, reproducible and smart listings for data review.

In this project you can see:

1. A Specification Document (Listing Specification_MIMIC_FILE) outlining requirements for 10 clinical listings. 
2. Both Python and SAS scripts which i created to generate the Listing outputs.
3. Output Listings generated from both implementations against each check in the specification.


📁 Project Structure


 📄 Listing Specification_MIMIC_FILE and DEMO_Datasets

 📂 1 SAS Listings
     📄 Listing.SAS
     📄 Listing_Output.xlsx


 📂 2 Python Listings
     📄 Listing.py

🛠️ Technologies Used:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, etc.)

NOTE: ALL the data has been completely generated and created by myself.
