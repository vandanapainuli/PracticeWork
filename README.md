I created this project demonstrates my ability to not only design specification but also implement clinical data listings. It highlights my skills to translate specifications into dynamic, reproducible listings for data review.

In this project you can see:

1. A Specification Document (Listing Specification_MIMIC_FILE) outlining requirements for 10 clinical listings. 
2. Both Python and SAS scripts which i created to generate the Listing outputs.
3. Output Listings generated from both implementations against each check in the specification.
